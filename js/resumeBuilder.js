Managed over 100 instructors and assigned teaching responsibilities to them.

Designed new brochure, book cover, class catalogue, flyers, and banners. Promoted and maintained government funded training programs by assisting customers and working with government liaisons.

Answered questions and mediated customer and instructor concerns as lead customer service representative and go-to employee for knowledge on our services and operations. Averaged over 70 emails per day in addition to other responsibilities."
